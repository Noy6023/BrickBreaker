# BrickBreaker
The brick breaker game with a twist ;)
<br>In the game there are 2 bats which move by sideways tilts of the phone.
<br>There are 2 modes - easy mode and hard mode.
<br>**In easy mode**, the bats move _**together**_ to the direction of the phone. You get _**1 point**_ for every brick hit.
<br>**In hard mode**, the bottom bat moves to the direction of the phone, but the top bat moves in the _**opposing way**_.
<br>You get _**2 points**_ for every brick hit.<br/>
<br> Easy mode vs Hard mode: <br/>
