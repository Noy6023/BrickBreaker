# BrickBreaker
## The brick breaker game with a twist ;)
<br>In the game there are 2 bats which move by sideways tilts of the phone.
<br>There are 2 modes - easy mode and hard mode.
<br>**In easy mode**, the bats move _**together**_ to the direction of the phone. You get _**1 point**_ for every brick hit.
<br>**In hard mode**, the bottom bat moves to the direction of the phone, but the top bat moves in the _**opposing way**_.
<br>You get _**2 points**_ for every brick hit.<br/>
<br> Easy mode vs Hard mode: <br/>

<br> In this screen you can customize the colors of the objects in the game - such as the ball, bricks, bats and background.
<br> In order to change a color of an object, click on the button right next to it. The color of the button represents the color of the object.
<br> Once you click on the button, you will be sent to the color picker screen, which will be explained right after this screen.
<br> In case you are lazy or undetermined, you can click the random button to get random colors.
<br> If you regret your choices, you can always go back to the defult state by clicking the defult button.
<br> Once you finish everything, click back to return to the home screen. Once the game starts you'll see the colors of the game are the ones you chose.
<br> In the easy mode example at the top of this page, you can see that the colors aren't the defult ones.

<br> In this screen you can see the top scores list of all the players that have chosen to upload theirs.
<br> At the top, you have your nickname and highest score (so you would know what score you are about to upload).
<br> Then there is the list. You can scroll through it and see the other players nicknames and top scores.
<br> After you have gotten impressed, you can upload your own score to the list. You just need to click the upload button.
<br> The text underneath is informing you that the changes will update automatically and that you can remove yourself from the list at any point.
<br> In case you regret, you can remove your score by clicking the remove button. It will remove you from the list.
<br> The list is in a cloud by Firestore.

# General Notes About The Game
<br> The game is developed in Xamarin Android.
<br> It was made for a school fianle project. The project was due the 31.3.21, but I likes working on it and finished very soon so I upgraded the app to be wider. I did it in a month and a half. The last commits are small and minor, to make the game more convenient.
